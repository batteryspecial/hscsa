The Hammett constant was briefed in README, and we will refer to it by para and meta, instead of the full name.

# Image 1

Points above the like (para > meta) are groups whose resonance (from PI). Resonance makes the group more electron-withdrawing at para, like for NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, CN, and carbonyl groups. They are EWG groups that can withdraw electrons through resonance.

Points below the line (meta > para) are resonance EDGs like NH₂, OH, OCH₃. These have lone pairs that donate into the ring via resonance. At benzylic positions, EDGs stabilize carbocations, favoring S<sub>N</sub>1.

Points on the line are primarily inductive with. minimal resonance Indeed, for purely inductive groups like CF₃, σ<sub>meta</sub>(0.43) ≈ σ<sub>para</sub>(0.54).

Frequency distribution of σ values shows the meta distribution is slightly narrower and shifted positive (standard deviation ~ 0.19), as most groups are weakly electron-drawing by pure induction. Remember that resonance effects do not affect the meta position.

In the para position, resonance offers more uncertainty (standard deviation ~ 0.40) and centere near zero (why?). Resonance amplifies both donation and withdrawal.

Para values are grouped by donators and withdrawers. 

The EDG group have negative para values, with notable outliers being the strongest resonance donors NH₂ and N(CH₃)₂. The EWG group have positive para values ranging from 0.2 to 0.9. NO₂, CN, and carbonyl groups cluster here. Weak categories and neutral groups fall between them.

Notice EWG has a much larger deviation than EDG, this is due to complexities like diverse mechanisms, limited strength of EDG resonance, orbital overlap, etc.

Average para values for common nonmetal (heteroatom) attachments.

- Si is slightly negative. Silyl groups (Si-C) are weak σ-donors.
- Sulfur is near zero. Sulfur lone pairs can donate, but it's also moderately electronegative.
- O is slightly positive, but this is an average over EDGs and EWGs, may not indicate full behavior. Oxygen's high electronegativity causes inductive withdrawal, but lone pairs enable resonance donation.
- Halogens are all positive. Fluorine, being the most electronegative element (4.0) makes up for its weak resonance donation.
- Nitrogen has a positive mean, but variable. Amino groups are strong EDGs, while nitro, cyano, and ammonium are strong EWGs. Depends entirely on oxidation state and bonding.

A linear regression plot of para vs meta with a Pearson Correlation coefficient of 0.899.

R² = 0.808. About 81% of variance in para is explained by meta.

The strong correlation suggest both constants are indicative of the same underlying mechanism, although the ~19% resonance variation is clearly evident for strong EDGs.
